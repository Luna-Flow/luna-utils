---

**What part of the code needs test coverage?**
Describe which function, class, or module needs additional test coverage. Be specific if possible (e.g., "Add tests for the `multiply()` function in the `matrix_operations.py` module").

**What kind of tests are needed?**
Describe the type of tests that should be added, such as unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, or edge case tests. Include any specific conditions, inputs, or scenarios that should be tested.

**Why is this test coverage needed?**
Explain why the tests are necessary. Is there a critical feature lacking test coverage? Are there parts of the code that haven't been tested thoroughly?

**What should the test cases validate?**
Provide a description of the expected behavior or outcomes the test cases should validate. Be as detailed as possible to ensure the tests cover all relevant aspects.

**Additional context**
If applicable, provide any additional context, such as related issues, recent code changes, or any known limitations in the current testing setup.

**If you know who is working on this part of the code, please cc @username here.**
